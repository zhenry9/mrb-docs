Network and Tech Problems
=========================

Network Outage
--------------
One of the very hardest things to deal with is a network outage. When the internet, or our local network goes down, it is hard to take payments, send orders, print tickets, or function generally.

Internet outage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If it is an internet service outage, we can still function in offline mode. Rather than rewrite the instructions for going into offline mode, I will link to the `Arryved Knowledge Base article <https://support.arryved.com/portal/en/kb/articles/offline-mode-25-4-2019>`_.

The key takeaways are:

- POS devices can't communicate with one another in offline mode. For this reason, we should take all orders on one single device in offline mode to avoid getting out of sync.
- When internet service is restored, the device must be `taken out of offline mode and synced <https://support.arryved.com/portal/en/kb/articles/offline-mode-cheat-sheet>`_.

Local network failure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If our local network hardware has failed, we will be unable to send tickets to the kitchen. Unless it is extremely slow, it is just not possible for us to operate this way. 

Steps for an attempted fix:

#. Open the network rack above the chest freezer in the prep room.
#. Turn the main power supply off.
#. Check temperatures. If the equipment is hot, make sure the case fans are running and unobstructed.
#. After allowing the equipment to cool, turn it back on and cross your fingers.

Pandora Not Working
-------------------
While this could be caused by a :ref:`Network Outage`, it's more likely than not that the Pandora/Mood Music box is crashed or overheated. This is the black box on the mini shelf above the desk in the prosecco room. Unplug it, make sure the vents are unobstructed, let it cool for a minute, then plug it back in.

If this doesn't work, check the input switch on the back of the silver Fosi Audio box. If it's set to Bluetooth, switch it back to line in.
