Draft System Problems
=====================

Beers are Foamy
---------------
Foamy, bad pouring beers can be caused by a number of things.

- Is only one beer pouring badly? Did you just change the keg?
    #. Wait, and see if it improves over time. Use a pitcher in the meantime.
    #. :ref:`Check the gas. <How to tell when a tank is low>`
    #. Try another keg.
    #. 86 the beer for the night.
    #. Ask Zach, Mark or Sam to put on a low-flow faucet.
- Are multiple beers pouring badly?
    - :ref:`Check the gas. <How to tell when a tank is low>`. This is most likely the problem.
    - Wait a bit for the pressure to equalize after changing a tank.
    - Send up a help flare! (Call Sam, Zach or Joe)
