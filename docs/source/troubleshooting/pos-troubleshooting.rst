POS Problems
============

Drawer Won't Open
-----------------
The drawer is connected to and controlled by the receipt printer. When the drawer won't open, it is almost always one of these problems with the receipt printer:

- **Out of paper:** get more paper from the prosecco room.
- **Paper jam:** open the printer, pull out the jammed paper, and close it.
- **Printer off:** sometimes the power button gets bumped. Turn it back on.
- **Cable loose:** make sure the power and internet cables are correctly connected at both ends.
- Stuck QR Code Order: Check the tablet in the Prep Room to make sure there are no red QR code tickets. This means that they have not been sent through. Click on the "Arryved Printing Co" app then go to "Print Jobs" and click "reprint" on any red QR orders. They should reprint up front, turn green, and all systems should be back online

If none of these fix the problem, it could be a :ref:`Network Outage`.

As a last resort, or to continue taking payments while working on a fix, the drawer can be opened with a key. The key is located in the Master Lock box above the safe in the prosecco room. The tax inspectors frown on using a key to open the register, so this should be a temporary fix only.

Kitchen Tickets Not Printing
----------------------------
The sooner you notice a problem with the kitchen printer the better, altough it is not always easy. The best indication, other than customers coming up and asking where their food is, is the printer icon on the top of the Arryved app. If it is red, that means there are tickets that failed to print.

Possible problems:

- **Out of paper:** get more paper from the back.
- **Paper jam:** open the printer, pull out the jammed paper, and close it. The kitchen printer can also get filled with paper scraps and fibers, which will cause an error. Remove the ink ribbon and blow out as much debris as possible. Reassemble and restart the printer.
- **Printer off:** sometimes the power button gets bumped. Turn it back on.
- **Cable loose:** make sure the power and internet cables are correctly connected at both ends.
- Stuck QR Code Order: Check the tablet in the Prep Room to make sure there are no red QR code tickets. This means that they have not been sent through. Click on the "Arryved Printin Co" app then go to "Print Jobs" and click "reprint on any red QR orders. They should reprint up front, turn green, and all systems should be back online

If none of these fix the problem, it could be a :ref:`Network Outage`.
