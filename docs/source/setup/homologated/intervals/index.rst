Intermediates and Speed Traps
=============================

An intermediate time, also known as a split time or an interval, is a time taken on course anywhere between the start and the finish. Intermediate times give coaches and athletes useful information. An intermediate time is taken using a photocell, similar to the :ref:`finish <Finish Setup>`.

A speed trap is an intermediate timer with an opening and closing beam at a fixed distance. Because the distance is known, the time between the beams can be used to measure speed. The opening beam of a speed trap normally doubles as an intermediate time.

Why intermediate times?
-----------------------

Intermediate times and speed traps allow coaches and athletes to compare performance on different sections of the course. They are useful for evaluating wax performance in flat sections, or skiing technique in steep sections. Intermediate times also add excitement for spectators and people watching in real time. 

Intermediate times are not homologated and not required. They are part of the System A electronic timing system and do not need any backups. When using intermediates, the goal should always be to get every split for every racer. However, a missed split or a misfunctioning intermediate timer is not a good reason to put a race on a long delay. The results are still legal and valid without intermediate times.

Choosing a location
-------------------

Intermediate times should separate the course into logical sections. Oftentimes these are the steep and flat sections. Take the example course below:

The first intermediate timer separates the top, steep section of the course. The second intermediate timer, with the attached speed trap, can be used to judge performance on the flats. The time between the second intermediate and the finish can be used to judge performance on the lower steep section.

If you are using a wired intermediate, you also need to consider the locations of your hill wire. Do you have a box in a location that makes sense for a split? If not, how much wire will you need to run to get there? Can you do it safely? If not, consider using a wireless intermediate.

Safety
------

Intermediate timers are on course where racers are likely traveling at high speed. It is essential to consider safety when you set them up. Stay out of spill zones, and **never use bamboo on course**. Trench the wire :ref:`under the snow <Under the snow>`. The :ref:`Electric Chainsaw` is an awesome tool for installing intermediates quickly and safely.
