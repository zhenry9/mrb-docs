Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Our amber ale has quite the rap sheet of awards, including taking the gold in the 2025 World Beer Cup! Its reddish copper complexion is complimented by an experience of nutty, semi-sweet caramel notes balanced by a roasted toffee bite that offers a full range of malty notes. It is a well balanced beer that is grounding and delightful. 

Name Origin
