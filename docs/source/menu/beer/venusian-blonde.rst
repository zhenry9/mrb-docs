Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Our blonde ale comes packed with a flavor profile that has a soft honey sweetness on toasty warm bread.  Its golden caramel color fills you with a warming sensation like the sun on a spring afternoon. At an ABV of 4.8% this is an easy afternoon cup of cheer. 

Name Origin
~~~~~~~~~~~
Named after a famous **climbing route** on Temple Crag. The actual name is Venusian Blind Arete. It is in reference to the planet Venus, and is probably a play on Venetian blinds.
