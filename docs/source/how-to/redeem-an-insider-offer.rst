General info
------------
Insider offers are sent to insider members periodically by email. The offers vary, but they all involve a discount on a particular item or type of item in exchange for points. The member **MUST** click the "Save Offer" button in the email before they are able to redeem it.

As a brewery with a Type 23 license, we are not allowed to give away anything at all for free, although we can offer whatever discount we want provided it doesn't encourage over-consumption.

Look up insider member
----------------------
If you know someone wants to redeem an offer, the first thing to do is look up their insider account. You can do this by clicking "Insider Lookup" on the tab name prompt. The easiest way to look someone up is by name. If someone is paying with a card linked to their account it is possible to look them up by swiping a card, although this isn't always reliable.

Take payment
------------
The prompt to apply the insider offer will be the last thing to appear before the signature screen. Hit pay, and swipe the card or take cash. If the insider member has an offer that is applicable to their tab, a prompt will show up at this point displaying it. Select the offer, then hit "Apply." The signature screen will then show up, with the discount displayed under "Comps."

It is only possible to apply one insider offer at a time. If the guest has more than one, you can split the qualifying items into different tabs and repeat the process for each tab.
