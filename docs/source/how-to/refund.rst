Do a Refund
===========
Mistakes happen, and sometimes it will be necessary to give a guest a refund.

When to give a refund
---------------------
Good reasons to give a refund:

- The guest never received the item.
- The guest received the wrong item, and no longer wants what they originaly ordered.
- There was something wrong with the item (burnt, they found a hair, etc.)
- The guest decides to cancel their order before it is made.

Bad reason to give a refund:

- The guest told you they didn't like it, but still ate the whole thing.
- The guest thinks the wait time is too long, but still wants their order.

Two ways of giving a refund
---------------------------
There are two ways of giving a refund: refunding single items, and voiding payment on a tab. Here are some guidelines on when to use each method.

When to refund a single item:

- When the guest didn't receive, or had a problem with, one item out of a large order.
- When the guest wants to change one item of a large order prior to it being made.

When to void a payment:

- When a guest is cancelling an entire order.
- When the tab was closed out incorrectly. For example, with the wrong card, another guest's card, or to card-on-file when the guest wants to pay cash.
- When the guest only ordered one item.

Refunding a single item

Refunding a single item is a good option when there was a problem with one item out of a large order. To refund an item, first ring it in like normal, making sure to add all the upcharged modifiers from the original order. Then, tap on the item, and hit the "REFUND" button. This will apply the item as a negative charge.

If the guest is exchanging one item for another, like sometimes happens with soft drinks, you can ring in the item they are exchanging for like normal, and the tab will be for the difference.

If the guest originally paid with a card, it is best practice to close the refund to the same card. This is to prevent the guest from disputing the original charge with their bank.

Voiding a payment
-----------------

Voiding a payment is a good option when a tab was closed out incorrectly, for example to the wrong card. Voiding the payment re-opens the tab, allows you to add or modify items, then take payment again. 

To void a payment, click on the tab total, then the "PAYMENTS" button. Hit "VOID" next to they payment you wish to cancel. The tab is now open and unpaid and can be modified.
