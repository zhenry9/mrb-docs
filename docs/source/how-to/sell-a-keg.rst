Sell a Keg
==========

Arrange in advance
------------------
All keg sales must be arranged in advance, and approved by Joe, Zach, or Sam. All customer keg requests are subject to approval and availability.

To handle a customer request, either in person or over the phone, fill out the keg sale request sheet. Blank sheets are located in the big binder under the register. Let Zach or Sam know, and they will follow up with the customer.

Fill out the ABC paperwork
--------------------------
There are two pieces of California ABC paperwork necessary to sell a keg. The state uses these forms to track kegs. In the event one of our kegs ended up somewhere it shouldn't be, the state would use this paperwork to find out who bought it.

The paperwork is located in the middle drawer of the plastic cabinet on the floor to the left of Sam's desk.

The first piece of paperwork is the Beer Keg Registration form. This is to collect identifying information from the purchaser.

We need to fill out the top part of the sheet. Our address is 186 S Main St, and our license number is 23-532481. The customer needs to fill out their personal info in the middle section, and we both need to sign the bottom.

The other piece of state paperwork is the Beer Keg Identification Tag. This is a set of three yellow stickers with numbers on it.

We fill out our info on the big sticker and stick it to the keg. These stickers can sometimes be hard to get off kegs, so it's helpful to stick it to your pants first to remove some of the stickiness. The two smaller stickers in the bottom right go on each copy of the Beer Keg Registration sheet. Once you've gotten all this filled out and stickers applied, the customer takes the white copy and we keep the pink copy.

Attach a Keg Collar
-------------------
Every keg that leaves the brewery needs to have a collar on it. These are found in the same plastic cabinet with the paperwork. Fill out the name and style of the beer, ABV, and volume. Our small kegs are 5 gallons, and our big kegs are 13.2 gallons. The date should be the date that is on the plastic cap on the keg. That is, the date the keg was filled, **NOT** the date it was sold.

Ring it up
----------
The final part is to ring up the keg, and any necessary deposits in the POS. Blonde, Kolsch, Lenticular, Lager, and anything else at the $6 pint price point is standard price. Everything else is premium.

There are a few locals that swap empty kegs for full ones every few months. We don't need to charge these guys a depost. However, for everyone else we should charge a $30 keg deposit. It's important that we put their name on the tab, or as a note on the deposit, or both, so we know how to refund the deposit when we return the keg.

Keg deposits can be viewed and refunded in the POS by going to the staff tab and hitting "Deposits."
