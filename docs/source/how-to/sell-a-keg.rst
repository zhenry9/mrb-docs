Sell a Keg
==========

All keg sales must be arranged in advance, and approved by Joe, Zach, or Sam. All customer keg requests are subject to approval and availability.

To handle a customer request, either in person or over the phone, fill out the keg sale request sheet. Blank sheets are located in the big binder under the register. Let Zach or Sam know, and they will follow up with the customer.
