Settle a SAR Tab
================
The Inyo Search and Rescue team occasionally comes in for a meal after a rescue mission. They order from us, give us paperwork, and the Sheriff's Office reimburses us later.

Key Points
----------
Here are a few major points regarding SAR tabs:

- Alcohol is NOT allowed on the SAR tab. Individual SAR members are allowed to drink alcohol, provided they pay for it separately.
- NA beers are no longer allowed on the SAR tab.
- The tip is calculated on the sub-total, before tax.
- The team leader needs to take a photo of the receipt and completed paperwork before they leave.

Procedure
---------
- Name the tab "SAR," and leave it open until the team leader comes up to close it. They will likely make multiple orders.
- When they're done, the team leader will come to the register with paperwork similar to below:

   Correctly filled-out SAR paperwork.

- Print the customer receipt for the tab.
- Multiply the **subtotal** by 0.18. This is the tip.
- Add the tip to the **total**. This amount goes next to TOTAL AMOUNT DUE.
- Staple the receipt to the paper, and let the team leader take a picture. This part is important!
- Put the paper in the bag with the cash drop.
- Close the tab out to check. For the check number, use the report number.
- Take the tip amount out of the drawer, and put it in the tip jar. Remember that the drawer will be short by this amount at the end of the night.
