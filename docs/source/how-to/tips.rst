Do Daily Tips
=============

Procedure
---------
#. Count drop and tip bags, and verify amounts are correct.
#. Use the `“Tips Distribution Worksheet” <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1za_TXWzNyfeG4FjSdg7rBejhFZfAsyZ1o0n550VldPA/>`_ Google sheet. Start with a blank sheet by going to the Tip Functions menu and selecting “Reset sheet”
#. In the `Arryved portal <https://portal.arryved.com>`_, go to Reporting->Sales->Sales Activity. Select the correct day, then download and open the .csv file.
#. Copy all of the contents of the .csv file, and paste into the “Reporting - Sales Activity” tab in the Tips Distribution Worksheet.
#. Repeat this process for the Reporting->Sales->Purchase Items report: download the .csv file, then copy the contents into the corresponding tab in the tips worksheet.
#. The credit card tips should now be in the worksheet. Enter in the cash tips and employee hours from Homebase.
#. Look for “Cash Due” on the bottom of the closeout slip. If the number is negative, take that amount out of the safe. If the number is positive, put that amount in. The “Change Needs” section of the “Scratch” tab will tell you which bills you need.
#. Enter your initials.
#. Go to the Tips Functions menu and select “Save to ODS”.
#. Go to the Tips Functions menu and select “Save totals” to save the numbers into the totals sheet.
