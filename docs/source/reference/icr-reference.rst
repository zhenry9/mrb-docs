611 Technical Installations
---------------------------

.. glossary::

	611.1 
	Communications & Cabling
		In all international competitions, it is highly recommended that there is
		multiple communications (telephone or radios, etc.) between the Start and
		Finish. Voice communication between Start and Finish must be assured
		by fixed wire connection or radio. In case of radio, this must be on a
		separate channel from that used by any other function of the OC.
		In Olympic Winter Games and FIS World Championships all
		communications and timing connections between Start and Finish must be
		assured by fixed wiring.

	611.2 
	Timing Equipment
		For all events in the FIS Calendar, electronic timers, start gates and photocells homologated by the FIS must be used. A list of these approved	devices will be published. Races using timing equipment other than those on the homologated FIS list will not be considered for FIS points. Specifications and procedures for timing are more fully described in a separate FIS Timing Booklet.
		
	611.2.1 
	Electric Timing
		For all international competitions, FIS World Cup, FIS Continental Cups and FIS competitions, two synchronised electronically isolated timing systems operating in time-of-day must be used. One system will be designated system A (main system), the other system B (back-up system)prior to the beginning of the race. Only exception for Parallel competitions, on Level 2, 3 and 4 where no system B is required. Time of day times must be immediately and automatically sequentially recorded on printed strips at the maximum precision of the timing device according to the requirements for homologation. The final result is calculated by subtracting the start time from the finish time for each skier’s run and is then expressed to 1/100th (0.01) precision by truncating the calculated net time on course. All times used for the final result must be from system A. If there is a failure of system A, a calculated net time from system B must be used following the same procedure as set out in art. :term:`611.3.2.1`. It is not permitted to substitute time-of-day times from system B for use with system A for the purpose of net time calculations. For all events, system A must be connected to its respective start gate contact. System B must be separately connected to another electronically isolated start gate contact. Refer to the FIS Timing Booklet for more details regarding cabling and complete wiring descriptions, diagrams and start gate installations. All timing equipment and technical installation should be set up or protected in such a way that danger to the competitors is avoided where possible. Synchronisation of the timing systems must occur as close as possible to the scheduled start for the first run of the day. Synchronisation of all systems must be maintained throughout each run. Timers must not be resynchronised during any run.
			
	611.2.1.1
	Start Gate 
		The start gate must have separate electronically isolated switch contacts for triggering the start inputs of both system A & B. If a start gate or start wand requires replacement during a run, it must be replaced with identical equipment in the same position
		
	611.2.1.2 
	Photocells
		For all events, there must be two photocell system(s) homologated by the FIS installed at the finish line. One is connected to system A. The other is connected to system B. Procedures and regulations for start gates and photocells are found in the FIS Timing Booklet.
		
	611.2.1.3 
	Start Clock 
		For DH, SG and GS, the use of a start clock that provides at least an acoustic countdown signal on the fixed start interval as prescribed by the Jury should be used as an aid to race management. This is mandatory for all Level 0,1 and 2 races.
		
	611.2.2
	Hand Timing
		Manual (hand) timing, completely separate and independent of the electronic timing, must be used for all competitions listed in the FIS Calendar. Stopwatches or hand operated battery powered timers that are installed at both the Start and the Finish and capable of expressing the time of day to at least 1/100th (0.01) precision qualify as proper hand timing devices. They must be synchronised prior to the start of the first run, with the same time-of-day as system A and system B (see art. :term:`611.2.1`). Printed records, either automatic or hand-written, of recorded hand times must be immediately available at the start and at the finish.
		
	611.2.3 
	Presentation of times 
		Organisers should provide appropriate facilities for continuous presentation of all registered times of all competitors.
		
	611.2.4 
	Timing without Cable
		For FIS Level 3 events only, it is permitted to use homologated timing equipment in such a way that hill cable connection between start and finish is not required. Refer to the FIS Timing Booklet for a detailed discussion of how this is possible.
	
611.3 Timing
------------

.. glossary::

	611.3.1 
		With electronic timing, the time is taken when a competitor crosses thefinish line and triggers the beam between the photo cells. In case of a fall at the finish where the competitor does not come to a full stop, the time can be taken without both of the competitor’s feet having crossed the finish line. For the registered time to become valid, the competitor must immediately completely cross the finish line with or without skis. With hand timing the time will be taken when any part of the competitor crosses the finish line. The finish controller determines the correctness of passage across the finish line.
		
	611.3.2 
		In the case of a failure of the main electronic timing system (system A), the results of the electronic back-up system (system B) will be valid as per art. 611.2.1. For the Olympic Winter Games, FIS World Ski Championships and FIS World Cup, a synchronised electronic timing system with printers, connected to the starting gate and to the photocells at the finish is obligatory. In case of a failure in the lines of the timing system between start and finish, this back-up system will allow the calculation of the times to 1/100ths of a second. In the case that time of day from either system A or system B are not available for a competitor, the calculated time of day as per art. :term:`611.3.2.1` will be considered valid.
		
	611.3.2.1 
	Utilisation of times taken by hand
		Hand times may be used in the official results after a correction has been calculated. Calculation of the correction: Subtract the electronic time from the time taken by hand for the 10 competitors starting before the missing time. If there are not 10 times before, complete the calculation with the remaining times after the missed time. The sum of the 10 time differences is divided by 10 and rounded up or down (0.044 -> 0.04, 0.045 -> 0.05) to give the correction which must be applied to the hand time of the competitor without an electronic time.
		
	611.3.2.2 
	Photo Finish
		A Photo Finish System may be used to determine a competitor´s finish time. In case of a failure of system “A” and “B”, and where the competition has been recorded by the Photo Finish System, this time must be used in place of hand-timing without any correction. The photo finish time is taken when any part of the competitor´s body first crosses the Finish line. The photo finish result is to be provided to the Jury only.
		
	611.3.3 
		The official timing strips from the printer will be given to the Technical Delegate for review. They will be kept by the OC until the official approval of the race or after any appeal dealing with timing or race results. A technical timing report form as prescribed by the FIS must accompany the race results and must be reviewed and sent by the chief of timing and reviewed and confirmed by the TD as approval of the race. All printed records from system A, system B and hand timing must be retained by the OC for a period of three (3) months after the competition or after any appeal dealing with timing or race results.
		
	611.3.4 
		When the official printing timer allows manual input or correction of a time, some type of indication (star, asterisk or other) concerning any effected change must be printed on all timing documentation.
		
	611.3.5
		Computer software calculating net times must use the precision of the time of the day as used in the timing device.
		
	611.4 
	Private timing and speed measurement equipment of the Teams
		Any request to install such equipment has to be made to the Jury by the	team captain concerned, and the Jury decides concerning approval of the	installation. At Olympic Winter Games, FIS World Ski Championships and FIS World Cup only the organisers timing equipment is permitted.

		the starting competitors can be behind them. All outside help is forbidden.
		By order of the starter, competitors must plant their poles in front of the
		start line, or where indicated. The Starter must not touch the competitor at
		the start. Pushing off from the start posts or other aids is forbidden and
		competitors must start only with the help of their ski poles.
		
	613.4 
	Start Signals
		10 seconds before the start, the starter will tell each competitor "10
		seconds". Five seconds before the start, the starter should count "5, 4, 3,
		2, 1" and then give the start command "Go - Partez - Los".
		(For Slalom see art. :term:`805.3`).

	613.5 
	Start Timing
		The start timing must measure the exact time when the competitors cross
		the start line with their leg below the knee.
		
	613.6
	Delayed Start
		A competitor who is not ready to start on time will be sanctioned. The Start
		Referee may however excuse such a delay if, in the start referee´s opinion
		the delay is due to "force majeure".
		For example, breakdown of a competitor's personal equipment or minor
		sickness of a competitor does not constitute "force majeure".
		In case of doubt, the Jury may allow the start provisionally.
		
	613.6.1 
		The start referee makes the decisions after consultation with the Jury
		(according to art. :term:`613.6.2` and :term:`613.6.3`) and must record the start numbers
		and names of competitors who were not allowed to start because of late
		appearance, or who were allowed to start in spite of late appearance, or
		who were allowed to start provisionally.

	613.6.2 
		In the case of fixed start intervals, delayed competitors may start at the
		fixed interval after they have reported to the start referee, in accordance
		with the decision of the Jury. The Start Referee informs the Jury as to
		when (after which start number) a delayed competitor is starting.
		
	613.6.3 
		In the case of irregular start intervals, the delayed competitor will start
		according to art. :term:`805.3`. The start referee informs the Jury as to when
		(after which start number) a delayed competitor is starting.
		
	613.7
	Valid and False Starts
		In competitions with a fixed start interval the competitor must start on the
		start signal. The start time is valid if it occurs within the following limits: 5
		seconds before and 5 seconds after the official start time. A competitor
		who does not start within that space of time will be disqualified.
		The start referee must inform the Referee of the start numbers and names
		of the competitors who made a false start or have contravened the starting
		rules.
		

615 The Finish
--------------

615.1 The Finish Area
	
.. glossary::


	615.1.1 
		The finish area should be plainly visible to competitors approaching the
		finish. It must be wide with a gently sloped smooth run-out.
		
	615.1.2 
		In setting the course with gates particular attention should be paid to
		directing competitors across the finish on a natural line adapted to the
		terrain.
		
	615.1.3 
		The finish area is to be fenced in. Any unauthorised entry is not allowed.
	
	615.1.4 
		Finish installations and closures should be set up or secured through
		suitable protection measures.
	
	615.1.5 
		For competitors who have finished their runs, a special area separated
		from the actual finish, is to be provided. In this area or corridor, it should
		be possible to make contact with the press (print, radio, TV and film)
		located in the media corridors.
		
	615.1.6 
		The competitor must leave the finish area through the official exit with all
		the competition equipment used in the race.
		
	615.2 
	The Finish and its Markings
		The Finish is marked by two poles or vertical banners which may be
		connected by a horizontal banner. In Downhill and Super-G races, the
		finish must be no less than 15 metres wide and in Slalom and Giant
		Slalom no less than 10 metres wide. In exceptional cases, the Jury may
		decrease this distance on the spot for technical reasons or because of the
		terrain. The width of the finish is considered to be the distance between
		the two finish poles or banners. The supports used to mount the timing
		devices must also be at least this far apart.
		The timing supports can usually be placed behind the finish poles or
		banners, on the downhill side. The finish line between the timing cells
		must be clearly marked horizontally with colouring substance.
		
	615.3 
	Crossing of the Finish Line and Recording of the Times
		The finish line must be crossed:
		- on both skis or
		- on one ski or
		- with both feet in case of a fall between the last gate and the finish line.
		In this case the time is taken when any part of the competitor's body
		stops the timekeeping system.
	
	615.4 
	Report
		The Finish Referee must make a report to the Referee immediately after
		the race or the official training.
		

617 Calculation and Announcement of Results
-------------------------------------------

.. glossary::

	617.1 
	Unofficial Times
		Times taken by the timekeepers must be considered unofficial times. They
		should be posted on a score-board which should be readily visible from
		the area provided for the competitors who have finished, and from the
		press area. Whenever possible, unofficial times should be announced to
		the public over loud-speakers.
		
	617.2 
	Announcement of Unofficial Times and Disqualifications
	
	617.2.1 
		As soon as possible after completion of the race, unofficial times and
		disqualifications must be published on the official notice board at the
		finish.
		The time limit for protest is counted from the moment of this
		announcement. (art. 643.4, 643.5)
		
	617.2.2 
		Oral announcement of disqualifications may replace the publication on the
		official notice board.
		It can be decided that protests can be delivered verbally to the Referee at
		the Finish within 15 minutes after the announcement of the
		disqualification. Protests submitted after this are considered null and void.
		The team captains must be informed beforehand of the announcement
		and protest procedure.
		
	617.3 
	Official Results
	
	617.3.1 
		Results are determined from the official times of those competitors who
		have been officially classified.
	
	617.3.2 
		Combined results are calculated by adding together the race times
		obtained in each event of the combined event. (or by adding the race
		points)
		
	617.3.3 
		If two or more competitors have the same time or the same number of
		points, the competitor with the higher start number must be listed first on
		the official list of results (ex aequo).
		
	617.3.4 
		The official result list must contain:
		- the name of the organising club or association
		- the name of the competition, the site, event, category and gender
		- the date of the race
		- all technical data such as the name of the competition course, altitudeat start and finish, vertical drop, FIS homologation number and, for Downhill and Super-G, the length of the course
		- the names and nations of the members of the Jury
		- for each run, the names and nations of the course setter and the forerunners, the number of gates (Slalom, Giant Slalom and Super-G between brackets number of direction changes) and the start time
		- the weather, the snow conditions on the course and the air temperature at race start and finish recorded at time of race start.
		- all details concerning the competitors, ranking, start number, code number, name and first name, nation (and possibly club), time and race points
		- the start number, code number, name, first name and nation of those competitors who were not at the start, did not finish or were disqualified in each run
		- the names of the official service companies, e.g. timing company, computer service etc.
		- the codex and F value
		- the penalty calculation sheet
		- the signature of the Technical Delegate
		
	617.3.5 
		Nations must be indicated by the designated FIS code of three capital
		letters (see FIS Bulletin or FIS Website).
		
	805.3 
	Start Signal for Slalom
		As soon as the order for the next start is received, the starter gives the
		competitor the warning "Ready", "Attention", "Achtung" and a few seconds
		later the start signal "Go! Partez! Los!". The competitor must start within
		about 10 seconds after this order.
