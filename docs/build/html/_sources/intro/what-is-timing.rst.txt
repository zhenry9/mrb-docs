What is Ski Race Timing?
========================

Most simply, timing a ski race is calculating the time between the moment a racer breaks the start wand and the moment they cross the finish line. It is calculated to the 1/100th of a second, and is used to rank competitors in a race and determine a winner. Without timing there can't be a race.

The goal of a ski race is to be safe, fair, fun and on time. The job of Race Department timing staff on race day focuses mainly on being fair and on time. Our priority is to get a legal time for every competitor, and to run the race in a fair, timely and legal manner. Equipment and methods need to conform to FIS and/or US Ski and Snowboard rules at all times. However, the job extends far beyond this. Preparation begins days or even weeks before an event begins, and repairing equipment and maintaining infrastructure is a year round project. This guide will walk you through setting up and running a race at Mammoth Mountain, as well as provide some reference material for our wiring infrastructure and equipment.
